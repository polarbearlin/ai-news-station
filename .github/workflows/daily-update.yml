      # Deploy to EdgeOne Pages (using Tencent Cloud Action or any static deployer)
      # Since there isn't a direct "official" EdgeOne Pages action widely known, 
      # we usually use a general CLI or specific deployment script.
      # For now, we will simulate the deployment or assume the user has a specific action in mind.
      # If EdgeOne Pages supports Git integration directly (like Vercel/Netlify), 
      # we just need to push the 'dist' folder to a branch like 'gh-pages' or similar.
      # Here we demonstrate pushing to 'gh-pages' branch which EdgeOne can likely pull from.
